# Java-OOP-Project

Coursework for Object Oriented Programming class. 


##Task

My partner and I were tasked with creating a text-based social media platform in Java by implementing OOP concepts. 

The platform includes users, posts, comments and endorsement that each have sets of behaviours and attributes. 

HTML is used to provide documentation of all the classes implemented. This can be accessed by running the files in the "doc" folder.
